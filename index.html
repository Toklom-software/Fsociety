            <p>This tool is intended strictly for entertainment purposes only — such as pranks, jokes among friends, and other harmless scenarios. All content generated during its use is created using the Grok neural network developed by a foreign company. The author of this tool is not responsible for any inaccuracies or peculiarities caused by the neural network’s behavior.</p>
        
            <p>All examples, descriptions, and scenarios presented within the tool are fictional. The author is mentally stable, holds no hostility toward any state or authority, and does not promote or engage in destructive behavior.</p>
        
            <p>The tool does not utilize or process any real personal data. All displayed or generated information is created via AI and has no direct correlation to actual individuals. In rare cases, the neural network may incorporate publicly available user data previously shared with large tech corporations (e.g., Google, Meta, etc.) in accordance with their platform agreements. Such data is accessed solely through open sources and does not violate any applicable laws.</p>
        
            <p>The author is not affiliated with, nor does he assist, any official entities or individuals, and explicitly condemns any unlawful actions. Should an individual become involved in legal investigations, the author is unable to provide any information due to data either being encrypted or not stored at all.
